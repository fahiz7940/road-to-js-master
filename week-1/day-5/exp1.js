//Variables

let name = "Fahiz"
let surname = "Muhammed"

console.log(name)
console.log(surname)

// we can also re-assign variables
let age = 21;
console.log(age)

age = 18;
console.log(age)

//if u never wanna re-assign a value then u can use constant
// const pi = 3.14;
// pi = 10
// console.log(pi)// its an error bcz we cant re assign a value to const.



// So in summary, there are two ways to declare a variable:
// -> let, which we can re-assign.
// -> const which we can’t re-assign and will throw an error if we try.
